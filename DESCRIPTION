Description: A fast solver for the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of a 
  multivariate log-concave probability function. Given a sample X, it estimates 
  a non-parametric density function whose logarithm is a concave function. Many 
  well-known parametric densities belong to that class, among them the normal 
  density, the uniform density, the exponential distribution and many more. 
  This package constitutes an alternative to the package logcondens, which is 
  confined to the univariate case and the package LogConcDEAD, which also 
  adresses the mutlivariate case but has much longer runtimes. See the vignette 
  for a more thorough comparison between the two. [Reference: Fabian Rathke,
