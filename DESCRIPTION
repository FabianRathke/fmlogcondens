Description: A fast solver for the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of a 
  multivariate log-concave probability function. Given a sample X, it estimates 
  a non-parametric density function whose logarithm is a concave function. Many 
  well-known parametric densities belong to that class, among them the normal 
  density, the uniform density, the exponential distribution and many more. This
  package provides functions for the estimation of a log-concave density and
  a mixture of log-concave densities in multiple dimensions. While being similar
  to the package LogConcDEAD, fmlogcondens provides much fast run times for 
  large samples (>= 250 points). As a reference see Fabian Rathke, Christoph 
  Schnörr (2015), <doi:10.1515/auom-2015-0053>.
